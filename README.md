# Medical Adherence System (Class Project)

This is a class project from my Fundamentals of Software Engineering course. My group selected a Medical Adherence System from the given options and went through most of the software cycle, including documentation. The class ran out of time to properly implement and deploy the software. When creating this project, no one in my group had experience in frontend or full-stack development. The resulting software is a Java desktop application that implements hash maps as the main data structure for storing information.
